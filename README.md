# Requirements:
###### 1.Google Colab
###### 2.Keras.models
###### 3.Keras
###### 4.Numpy

# Dataset:
I used MNIST dataset. The MNIST database of handwritten digits has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples.MNIST is a subset of a larger set available from NIST (it's copied from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

# Encode and Decode Phases:
In this project, first, I encoded these handwritten digits, and then they were decoded by the decoding technique, and the initial images of the handwritten digits were obtained. The focus of this project was on decoding and decoding techniques of images.
